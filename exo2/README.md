# Hands on Docker image and Dockerfile
https://labs.play-with-docker.com/

## 1) Simple node application
Go through appV0 to appV5

Those application are based on either python or nginx.

You will have to create different Dockerfiles by slowly adding more parameters.

## 2) Simple node application

Based on the nodejs application you'll pull here : <https://github.com/hackages/hackjam-kubernetes/tree/master/exercices/hello-ip>

Try to create a Dockerfile by following <https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/>

When the application is running, you should be able to see something like this :

![hello-ip](/exo2/images/hello_ip.PNG)

## 3) Push your image to your own docker hub

Create an account here : <https://hub.docker.com/> and try to push your hello-ip image
